##Python script

This is a simple python script that works like an alarm clock. The theory of operations goes like this:

> User runs the script
> Prompt will ask the user to input the time to be awaken ( what time the alarm will go off )
> Input format will be in military time
> After the user inputs a valid time, the script runs on a loop, refreshing and checking if time set == current time
> If it is, webbrowser package will launch and open and play a youtube video
> **the youtube links are saved in the YT.txt file, in which a single link will be randomly chosen for our script

Disclaimer: This is an edited version of an existing python script found on reddit. I do not claim any of the videos in the YT.txt file links.

I figured I'd get back in touch with python programming. This will be edited and hopefully I could add more features to it.
